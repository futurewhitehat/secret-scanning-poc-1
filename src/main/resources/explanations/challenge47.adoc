=== HashiCorp Vault Template Injection Part 2

Secrets can be retrieved from Vault using the https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/injector[Vault Agent] sidecar container, which runs alongside your main application container. This sidecar can inject the secrets into your applications environment.
A developer tried to debug why his vault injection did not work. So, he hardcoded the secrets "temporarily" in the Vault template itself.
Can you find the secret hardcoded in the Vault Template?
