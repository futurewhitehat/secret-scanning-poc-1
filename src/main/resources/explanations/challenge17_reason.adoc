*Why entering secrets in bash is a bad idea.*

The command line can feel temporary and safe but it is often being logged. This is a standard feature with most shells. Some do have protections in place and most tools that request a secret will not print it in any form. However when doing custom commands these protections are not in place and you can easily shoot yourself in the foot.

Leaking secrets is little hard to do with a Dockerfile when creating a container, however if you have a container that you are using regularly and do not delete. These history issues could arise and a malicious actor could use your seemingly innocuous docker container to escalate privileges and potentially attack something a lot more vital than your pc.
