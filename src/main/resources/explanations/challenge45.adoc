=== Vault subkey challenge

Sometimes, all you want to do, is having that concise entry in your secrets management system. So what about storing your usnerame and password in the same entry?
We tried doing that, but got into a new problem! Because with Hashicorp Vault you can setup policies to allow access to a subkey (Which is the key to the value of your secret). Can you find the very random username we setup in this challenge?
