*Why we need to be careful with security credentials in CI/CD*

People who can access the configuration of your security checks in your CI/CD environment, can easily get access to the credentials. These credentials can then be used for anything and not just for security checks.

This is why security should be very careful in managing their own secrets: just because the credential is used by (a) security (tool), does not mean it should be secured less ;-).
