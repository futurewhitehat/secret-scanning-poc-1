This challenge is specifically looking at a secret in a C binary

You can solve this challenge using the following steps:

1. Find the secrets with https://ghidra-sre.org/[Ghidra].
- Install https://ghidra-sre.org/[Ghidra].
- Start it whit `ghidraRun`.
- Load the application `wrongsecrets-c` into ghidra by choosing a new project, then import the file and then doubleclick on it.
- Allow the Ghidra to analyze the application.
- Search for the secret: Go to `Functions` on the left-hand side, select `_secret` . Now on the screen on the right-hand side you can see the secret. This is a string in C.
- Search for the secret, which is "hidden" as a char array: Go to `Functions` on the left-hand side, select `_secret2`. See that this returns a label on your right-hand side. Now open `Labels` on the left-hand side, select the label returned by `_secret2` (`_secret2.label`) and find the answer in the center. This is a Char array in C.
