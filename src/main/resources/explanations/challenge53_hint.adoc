This challenge can be solved using the following steps:

1. Identify the running pod in Kubernetes:
   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```
2. Attach a debugging container to the running pod:
   ```
   kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c sidecar -- /bin/sh
   ```
3. Navigate to the shared directory where the binary is stored:
   ```
   cd /shared-data
   ```
4. Use `gdb` to inspect the binary and run it:
   ```
   gdb wrongsecrets-challenge53-c-linux
   run &
   ```
5. Locate the memory address of the secret:
   ```
   print &secret
   x/s <memory-address>
   ```

By analyzing the memory, you will uncover the hardcoded secret stored within the binary.
