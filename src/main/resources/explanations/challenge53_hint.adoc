By default, the challenge runs without a debugging sidecar. Your goal is to analyze the binary running inside the pod and uncover the secret.

This challenge can be solved using the following steps:

1. Deploy the challenge without the sidecar:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f k8s/challenge53/secret-challenge53.yml
   ```
   Verify that the pod is running:
   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```

2. Realize that the pod alone does not provide debugging capabilities. Now, replace the deployment with one that includes a sidecar:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f k8s/challenge53/secret-challenge53-sidecar.yml
   ```

3. Run the debugging container attached to the running pod:
   ```
   kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c sidecar -- /bin/sh
   ```

4. Navigate to the shared directory where the binary is stored:
   ```
   cd /shared-data
   ```

5. Use `gdb` to inspect the binary and run it:
   ```
   gdb wrongsecrets-challenge53-c-linux
   run &
   ```

6. Locate the memory address of the secret:
   ```
   print &secret
   x/s <memory-address>
   ```

By analyzing the memory, you will uncover the hardcoded secret stored within the binary.
