=== Kubernetes StringData or Data?

Kubernetes has 2 types of fields for data in a secret. The `StringData` contains the plaintext data, while the `Data` contains the base64 encoded value.
So what if you want to swap StringData value to a Data value in order to further secure it?
You don't have to, as long as you have setup RBAC correctly, after all: both values should not be visible when a secret is listed or described. But what if you move from standard secrets to sealed secrets because your users do need to be able to get the secrets, but not all of them?
Then it might be good to know that the metadata might contain the actual value of the StringData.
Can you find the secret?
