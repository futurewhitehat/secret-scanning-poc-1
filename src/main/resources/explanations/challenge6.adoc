=== Challenge 6: K8s Secrets

Hardcoding something in docker was not smart. But what about a K8s secret in the default namespace without RBAC?

Spin up Minikube or a K8s cluster as the `README.md` instructs you, and then find the secret. You might have spotted it as well if the secret was committed to Git for instance.
