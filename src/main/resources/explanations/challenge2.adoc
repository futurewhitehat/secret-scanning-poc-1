=== Hardcoded password part 2

TODO: CONTINUE HERE!

There is a hardcoded password directly hidden in the controller by a developer. He tried to hide it by putting the value in the `application.properties`.


This you can easily detect by SAST solutions, solutions like https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog[truffleHog] and https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets[git-secrets], and by manual inspection of your `application.properties`.
