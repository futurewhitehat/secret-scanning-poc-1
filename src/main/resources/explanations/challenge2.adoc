=== Hardcoded password part 2

Instead of hardcoding the password directly, the developer now tried to hide it in the Spring Boot its `application.properties`.

This means it is no longer to be found directly in `.java` or in compiled `.Class` files. So how can you detect it?

This you can easily detect by SAST solutions, solutions like https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog[truffleHog] and https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets[git-secrets], and by manual inspection of your `application.properties`.
