This challenge is specifically looking at a secret in a Rust binary based on a https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#release[release profile].

You can solve this challenge using the following steps:

1. Find the secrets with https://ghidra-sre.org/[Ghidra].
- Install https://ghidra-sre.org/[Ghidra].
- Start it whit `ghidraRun`.
- Load the application `wrongsecrets-rust` into ghidra by choosing a new project, then import the file and then doubleclick on it.
- Allow the Ghidra to analyze the application.
- Now import https://gist.github.com/str4d/e541f4c28e2bca80d222434ac1a204f4[demangle script] and run it via the Ghidra Script manager to demangle the functions.
- Find the entrypoint of the application (`lang_start_internal`).
TODO:
- Find comparison and return
- Find what it compares with
/TODO
- Alternatively: Go to the data type manager in the bottom left, now filter for `string`, now right-click at `string` as a member of `wrongsecrets-rust` and select `find uses of`.
- Now filter for known keywords: you should easily be able to find the secret now!

2. Find the secrets with https://www.radare.org[radare2].
- Install https://www.radare.org[radare2] with either `brew install radare2` on Mac or follow these steps: `git clone https://github.com/radareorg/radare2; cd radare2 ; sys/install.sh`
- Launch r2 analysis with `$ r2 -AAA wrongsecrets-rust`
- Print the entrypoint `pdf main`.
TODO
- Find comparison and return
- Find what it compares with
/TODO

- Find comparison and return
- Find what it compares with

- Alternatively: after launching radare2, run `iz | grep secret` and find the string.
