You can solve this challenge by the following steps:

1. Use `docker history`:
- download the container,
- run `docker history --no-trunc  jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<TAGNAME-HERE>` with which you can find the arguments used for the container with the given tag.
- Now try finding the `ARG_BASED_PASSWORD` .
2. Visit the repository online:
- go to the https://hub.docker.com/r/jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets[*WrongSecrets docker repo*]
- take a look the tag relevant for you. There you can find all the commands used to compose the container. What is the value of `ARG_BASED_PASSWORD` ?
3. Use Dockle https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle[*Dockle*]:
- Install Dockle as described at its https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle[Github page]
- Run `dockle jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<TAGNAME-HERE>` and use its output for your secrets hunt.
4. Exec into the container and dump the ENV-vars:
- Start the container locally with `docker run jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<TAGNAME-HERE>`
- Find the container id by doing `docker ps` in a next terminal
- now do `docker exec -it <container id> "/bin/sh"`
- in the container do `env` .
