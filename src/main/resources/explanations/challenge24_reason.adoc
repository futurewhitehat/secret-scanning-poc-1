*Why copying Specs is a bad idea*

When you try to implement cryptographic controls, it can be very daunting: there are a lot of details you need to pay attention to.
By now you know that it is not recommended to copy every primite of an example for your own implementation. In this example we copied the HMAC key from a NIST spec, which anybody could have tried to use in order to brute-force the HMAC key used.

Please note that copying keys from specs/examples does not only hold for HMACs, it holds for any cryptographic operation (signing, encryption, decryption, etc.).
