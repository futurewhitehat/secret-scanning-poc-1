*Why Proper Handling of Sealed Secrets is Important?*

Sealed Secrets provide a way to encrypt your Kubernetes secrets and store them safely, even in public repositories.
However, improper handling and misconfiguration can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.

If the private key used to decrypt the sealed secrets is exposed or accessible within the same repository, it nullifies the security provided by the Sealed Secrets.
Anyone with access to the repository can decrypt the secrets, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access.

Let's consider an example:

. Imagine a scenario where a developer stores the private key used for Sealed Secrets decryption in the same repository:
* The repository contains `sealed-challenge48.json` and the private key `main.key`.
. This situation is analogous to locking a door and leaving the key under the doormat:
* An attacker can easily find the key and unlock the door, gaining access to everything inside.

To prevent such issues, it is crucial to ensure that private keys are stored securely and separately from the encrypted data.
Always follow best practices for secret management and avoid exposing sensitive information in your repositories.

Note: even when you keep the private key away from the repository, if you don't configure RBAC or ABAC correctly, anyone can still access the secret when they have access to the cluster.
