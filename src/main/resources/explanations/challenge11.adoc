=== Challenge 11: AWS SSM Parameter Store

We've now used Parameter Store directly from within the app, but there's an IAM problem...

Assume the role `cant-read-secrets` and try some IAM privilege escalation. Don't cheat using your own roles :)

Here is where tools like https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite[ScoutSuite] can really help detecting issues with your IAM that can help you to identify possible paths towards privilege escalation. 

If you're stuck, try spotting the error in Terraform.
