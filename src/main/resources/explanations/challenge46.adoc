=== HashiCorp Vault Template Injection

Secrets can be retrieved from Vault using the https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/injector[Vault Agent] sidecar container, which runs alongside your main application container. This sidecar can inject the secrets into your applications environment.
 One way to do this, is by means of rendering the secrets as a file. The file can then be picked up by your target application. However, in this case, the developer was unsure if the file was picked up, so instead of exporting the secret as an env-var, he `echo`-ed them.

Can you find the secret injected into application environment?
