=== Risks of sensitive data in SSH configuration files

Developers frequently store SSH connection configurations in `.ssh/config` files. However, this convenience may lead to the accidental inclusion of sensitive information, such as passwords or keys, which could become forgotten over time.

Forgotten secrets indicate inadequate security checks and poor secret management practices.

This challenge emphasizes the importance of secure storage practices and periodic auditing of sensitive configuration files.
