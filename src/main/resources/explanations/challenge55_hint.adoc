The private key is located inside the .ssh part of the container and accidentally comitted to git in this case ;-).

You can find the key by:

1. obtaining it from git in the [`.ssh/wrongsecrets.keys`]() file:
- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets`.
- Go into the projects root and cd into `.ssh` folder and find the `wrongsecrets.keys` file.

2. obtaining it from the docker container:
- Start the container locally with `docker run jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<TAGNAME-HERE>`
 - Find the container id by doing `docker ps` in a next terminal
 - Do `docker exec -it <container id> sh`
 - go to /home/wrongsecrets/.ssh/
 - do `cat wrongsecrets.keys`
