=== Vault Metadata Challenge

Secrets management systems now often have metadata support for their secrets! This is awesome, as it allows you to further enrich the secret with contextual data so it becomes easier to remember what the secret was about.

But what if you put confidential/secret information into a secret by mistake?

A developer has put some secret metadata to a `wrongsecret` in Vault. Can you find it?
