=== Git Notes

Git commits can be a constant pain point.
It is fine using a short message, unintelligible garble or mashing the keyboard in a git message until you have the unfortunate task of reviewing past commits and trying to figure out what has happened.
Git notes is here to solve this, it has been around for a while but often gets overlooked.
Add extra metadata about the commit without affecting the commit message itself.

Like all Git, once information is commited it is very very hard to remove all reference of it. What could possible go wrong?
