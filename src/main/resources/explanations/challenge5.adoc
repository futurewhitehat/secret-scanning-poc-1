=== Challenge 5: K8s Configmap based secret

Hardcoding something in docker was not smart. But what about a config-map in the default namespace with no RBAC?

Spin up Minikube or a K8s cluster as the README instructs you, and then find the secret. You might have spotted it as well if the configmap was committed to Git maybe.
