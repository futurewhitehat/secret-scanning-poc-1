=== .ssh Secret Challenge

The SSH configuration file (`.ssh/config`) simplifies SSH connections by storing host-specific configurations. However, this convenience sometimes leads developers to unintentionally expose sensitive details, especially when encrypted secrets or hints are added as comments or extra parameters.

An encrypted secret and the key to decrypt it have been hidden within `.ssh/config` as a comment.

Find and decrypt this forgotten secret.

==== Note
The secret is encrypted using AES-256-ECB and no salt. Use the key found in ".ssh" directory to decrypt it.
