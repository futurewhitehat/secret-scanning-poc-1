=== .ssh Secret Challenge

The SSH configuration file (`.ssh/config`) simplifies SSH connections by storing host-specific configurations. However, this convenience sometimes leads developers to unintentionally expose sensitive details, especially when encrypted secrets or hints are added as comments or extra parameters.

An encrypted secret has been hidden within `.ssh/config` as a comment.

Find and decrypt this forgotten secret.

==== Hint
The secret is encrypted using AES-256-CBC. Use the provided passphrase to decrypt it.

The passphrase is "key_to_decrypt_the_secret".
