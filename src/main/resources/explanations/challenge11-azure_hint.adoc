You can solve this challenge by the following steps:

- Check your vault name with `terraform output vault_name`.

- Create a new pod file `pod.yaml` with the following content (replace the vault name with output from the previous step):

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: wrongsecret-3
  labels:
    aadpodidbinding: separate-workload-pod-id
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: az
          image: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli:latest
          command: ["az", "keyvault", "secret", "show", "--name=wrongsecret-3", "--vault-name=YOUR_VAULT_NAME_HERE"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

This job executes something like the command `az keyvault secret show --name wrongsecret-3 --vault-name wrongsecrets-vault-00000`. Since the job can access the same vault as the secret challenge pod, it has access to its secrets.

- Apply the job with `kubectl apply -f job.yaml`
- Check the job's logs with `kubectl logs job/wrongsecret-3`. This should show you the solution :)
