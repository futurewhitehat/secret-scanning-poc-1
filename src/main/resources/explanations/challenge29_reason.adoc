*Why posting Screenshots of logs and outputs in a GitHub issue  is a bad idea?*

You should never post Screenshots of logs and outputs in a GitHub issue because even when the issue is closed all data is public,  is very easy to spot and screenshots cannot be edited like normal text.

Check for any generated passcodes in the output and make sure it is blurred out after taking its screenshot before posting it in GitHub issue.
