You can solve this challenge by the following steps:

1. Check the status of the configmap in Git
- Can you see where in git we stored the `secrets-config.yml`? If not, just do a search.
- Take a look at the `Data` field: what can you find there?
2. Ask nicely using Kubectl:
- TODO: CONTINUE HERE!

3. Exec into the pod and get the data
