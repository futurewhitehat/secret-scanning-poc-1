As the challenge states you need to be looking for the Bash commands that have been written in the past, what command may give us this?

You can solve this challenge using the following steps:

1. First access the bash shell of the container, this can be done with `docker exec -it {Image Name} bash` (Replace the curly brackets and the text with the docker image name e.g. jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:sometag)

2. One way to find the answer is using the command `history`. However you may find there is an awful lot to look through.

3. The second way is printing the contents of the file .bash_history. This can be done with `cat ~/.bash_history`. Once you have this file you can use grep or any other search tool to narrow down the answer.
