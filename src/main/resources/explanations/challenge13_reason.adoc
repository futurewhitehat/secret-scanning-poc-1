*Why you need to be careful with CI/CD and secrets*

When you use CI/CD tooling, you often need to let the tooling (e.g. runner/agent which executes a job) use some sort of secret to authenticate to a secondary service. When this is required, it can become quite interesting to try exfiltrating these secrets.
There are various ways to do this:

- run a CI/CD tool in debug mode, or request more env vars, which then might be readable to everybody who has access to the build(log)
- use exfiltration techniques such as the ones useful in this challenge to get the secret, which then might be readable to everybody who has access to the build(log)
- Use your access rights as an admin/maintainer of a repository and/or project to get the secrets.

This is why it is key that you:

- Limit who has access to the job runs/job configuration/actual secrets
- Log all actions of the system and alert on any exfiltration actions
- Make sure that you have no long-term living secrets in your CI/CD setup

*Why Crypto is still very hard*

As you can tell at the Challenge13 source-code: we selected a pre-defined IV. This was done in order to make sure we would end up with the same ciphertext every time.
One could argue that this is a bad shape of https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_CheatSheet.md#72-convergent-encryption[Convergent Encryption].
This has a benefit: you can now tell whether a secret has changed if you have a fixed key and IV. However, this will get you into trouble if secrets are too short, so that you end up with a collision when trying to find the plain-text by encrypting various plaintext pieces hoping to end up with the same ciphertext.
