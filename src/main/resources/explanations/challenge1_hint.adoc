As the text of the challenge says, we are looking for a secret called `password` in the Java code. But how do we find it?

You can solve this challenge by the following steps:


1. Use https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog[*Trufflehog*] to scan the repository for secrets:
- Read up on the instructions of the tool at https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog[Trufflehog] and install it using `pip3 install truffleHog` or use its docker container.
- Now run Trufflehog at our repository: `trufflehog https://github.com/commjoen/wrongsecrets`. Can you find the value of `public static String password` in the output?
2. When you do not have the source code available, try to obtain the actual application to reverse engineer it. The application, in this case, is a Jar file, which is a set of java class files together with a few resources.
- Follow the instructions of https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/[the Docker documentation] to copy the Jar file from the container's root to your local filesystem.
- open the JAR file in https://java-decompiler.github.io/[*JD-GUI*] or https://github.com/skylot/jadx[*jadx-gui*], now look for the `String password`!
