You can solve this challenge by the following steps:

1. Use https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog[*Trufflehog*]: checkout the repository
- Read up on the instructions of the tool at https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog[Trufflehog] and install it using `pip install truffleHog` or use its docker container.
- Now run Trufflehog at our repository: `trufflehog https://github.com/commjoen/wrongsecrets`. Can you find the value of `public static String password` in the output?
2. When you do not have the sourcecode available:
- Follow the instructions of https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/[the Docker documentation] to copy the Jar file from the root of the container to your local filesystem.
- open the JAR file in https://java-decompiler.github.io/[*JD-GUI*], now look for a password!
3. Retry step 1 with https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets[*Git Secrets*]
