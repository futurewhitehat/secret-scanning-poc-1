You can solve this challenge by the following steps:

Note this challenge requires you to install https://www.keepassx.org/[Keepass(X)] on your system to open the kdbx file.

1. Get the Keepass file from the Docker container and open it.
 - take a look at the Dockerfile to see where the keepass file has been copied to.
 - Follow the instructions of https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/[the Docker documentation] to copy the Keepass file from the root of the container to your local filesystem.
- Open the file using KeepassX. You will be asked a password.
- First check in the code of `Challenge14.java` in https://github.com/commjoen/wrongsecrets/blob/master/src/main/java/org/owasp/wrongsecrets/challenges/docker/Challenge14.java[github] to see where the password might be stored. Then open the `Application.properties` file in the `src/resources` folder at https://github.com/commjoen/wrongsecrets[*the target repo*]  and take a look at the property holding the keepass password.
- Now use the password you found to open the Keepass file. This should allow you to find credentials to Alibaba Cloud. This is the answer!
2. Get the Keepass file from the test resources: we were silly enough to put the same file in `src/test/resources/alibabacreds.kdbx` so you can open that ass well.
 - Checkout the project using git and open the file, or : go get it from https://github.com/commjoen/wrongsecrets/blob/master/src/test/resources/alibabacreds.kdbx[Github]
 - Open the file using KeepassX. You will be asked a password.
 - First check in the code of `Challenge14.java` in https://github.com/commjoen/wrongsecrets/blob/master/src/main/java/org/owasp/wrongsecrets/challenges/docker/Challenge14.java[github] to see where the password might be stored.
