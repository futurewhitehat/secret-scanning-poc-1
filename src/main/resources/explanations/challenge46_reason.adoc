*Why Vault Template Injection is not always a good idea?*

While Vault agent injection via templates can be a convenient way to manage secrets in certain scenarios,

Templates might accidentally expose sensitive information in logs or temporary files.
If not properly configured, secrets could end up in places where they are accessible by unauthorized users or processes.
