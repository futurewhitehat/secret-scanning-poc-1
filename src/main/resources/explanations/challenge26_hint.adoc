You can find the previous state one of two ways.

Option 1:
1. Find the block number for any block after the contract was created and before it was updated.
2. Search for the storage state of the contract for that block. The below command is an example vs the infura API:
 curl https://goerli.infura.io/v3/${your-infura-key} \                         
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "eth_getStorageAt", "params": ["${contract address}", "0x0", "${blocknumber}"], "id": 1}'

Option 2:
1. Look under the contract creation transaction on etherscan
2. Go to state and look at storage
