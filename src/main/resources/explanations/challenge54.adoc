=== .gitignore Secret Challenge

`.gitignore` files help avoid accidental commit of sensitive or irrelevant data into source control. However, sometimes developers mistakenly add sensitive data or secrets as comments or hidden entries within `.gitignore`.

In this challenge, a developer left behind an encrypted secret in a `.gitignore` file comment. Even though encrypted, it highlights how easy it is to forget critical secrets in accessible locations.

Your goal is to find and decrypt this forgotten secret.

==== Note
The secret is encrypted using AES-256-CBC and with an IV. Use the key found in ".gitignore" to decrypt it.
We used the following command for encryption:

```bash
echo -n "<you will have to find out>" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc \
  -K $(echo -n "<look for this key>" | sha256sum)  \
  -iv 30313233343536373839616263646566 \
  -nosalt -base64
```
