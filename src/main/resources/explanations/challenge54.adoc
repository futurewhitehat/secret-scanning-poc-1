=== .gitignore Secret Challenge

`.gitignore` files help avoid accidental commit of sensitive or irrelevant data into source control. However, sometimes developers mistakenly add sensitive data or secrets as comments or hidden entries within `.gitignore`.

In this challenge, a developer left behind an encrypted secret in a `.gitignore` file comment. Even though encrypted, it highlights how easy it is to forget critical secrets in accessible locations.

Your goal is to find and decrypt this forgotten secret.

==== Hint
The secret is encrypted using AES-256-CBC. Use the provided passphrase to decrypt it.

The passphrase is "key_to_decrypt_the_secret".
