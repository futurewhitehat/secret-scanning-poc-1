=== Password Shucking

A website was using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5[MD5] for hashing passwords, and its developers recently decided that it's a good idea to migrate to a stronger hashing algorithm like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt[bcrypt].

The developers decided that the easiest way to migrate would be to hash the pre-existing hashes using bcrypt. Using two hashing algorithms would be more secure than using one, right? It appears so.

For this challenge, you are provided with two database dumps containing usernames and passwords. The dump file https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets/tree/master/src/main/resources/executables/db-dump.txt[db-dump.txt] was generated before the migration and the other dump file https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets/tree/master/src/main/resources/executables/db-dump-2.txt[db-dump-2.txt] was generated after the migration. Both dump files are available inside the https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets/tree/master/src/main/resources/executables[executables folder].

Now, assuming that all the users except one have changed their passwords, can you find it?
