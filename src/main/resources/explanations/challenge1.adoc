=== Challenge 1: Hardcoded password

There is a hardcoded password directly hidden in the controller. Using secrets in `application.properties` is not a proper way to keep your secrets safe as they are part of your source code and are visible by anyone with access to your source code repository.

This you can easily detect by SAST solutions, solutions like https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog[truffleHog] and https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets[git-secrets], and by manual inspection of your `application.properties`.

Using a distributed solution like https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/[Spring Cloud Config] where you manage your application properties externally can have the same problem if you are not careful. Take a close look at the https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/#_security[security section] before using Spring Cloud Config.
