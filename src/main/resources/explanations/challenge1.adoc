=== Challenge 1: Hardcoded Password

There is a hardcoded password directly hidden in the controller.
a developer tride to hide it by overloading it using the Spring Framework using the default `application.properties`.

This you can easily detect with SAST solutions, solutions like https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog[*Trufflehog*] and https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets[*Git-secrets*], and through manual inspection of your `application.properties`.
Watch out for solutions like Spring Config Server where we will overload it again using a centralized approach.
