=== Challenge 1: Hardcoded Password

There is an hardcoded password directly hidden in the controller.
So a developer though the was smart, by overloading it by the Spring Framework using the default `application.properties`.

This you can easily detect by SAST solutions, solutions like Trufflehog and Git-secrets, and by manual inspection of your application.properties.
Watch out with solutions like spring config server where we will overload it again using a centralized approach.
