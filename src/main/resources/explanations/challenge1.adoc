Sometimes the simpler tools are the most effective. Try cloning the repo and use https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html[*grep*] to see what you find. 

You can also find the answer using https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets[*Git-secrets*] once you have added this rule `git secrets --add 'password\s*=\s*.+'`. Just dive into the code!
