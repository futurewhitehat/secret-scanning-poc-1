=== Challenge 1: Hardcoded Password

There is a hardcoded password directly hidden in the controller.
So a developer tride to hide it, by overloading it by the Spring Framework using the default `application.properties`.

This you can easily detect by SAST solutions, solutions like Trufflehog and Git-secrets, and by manual inspection of your application.properties.
Watch out for solutions like Spring Config Server where we will overload it again using a centralized approach.
