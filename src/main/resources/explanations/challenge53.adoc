=== Debugging Container Leak

Modern cloud environments often rely on debugging tools to troubleshoot issues in running applications. However, when debugging capabilities are left open in production, they can expose sensitive information.

A Kubernetes deployment has been misconfigured, allowing developers to attach a debugging container to a running application. Inside this pod, a binary holds a secret in memory. Normally, this secret would be protected, but due to the debugging access, it becomes retrievable.

Can you uncover the secret?
