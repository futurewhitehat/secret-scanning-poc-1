Like other Git challenges this can be solved by manually combing the Git metadata.
There are also a plethora of tools that will automatically search for secrets leaked in Git repos.

1. Search manually using `git log`. You can then use a tool such as grep to try and find leaked secrets with regex searches.
- Clone the repository (`git clone git@github.com:OWASP/wrongsecrets.git`)
- cd into the directory (`cd wrongsecrets`)
- Fetch the notes (execute `git fetch origin refs/notes/commits:refs/notes/commits` and `git fetch origin "refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*"`)
- now do a `git log` and search for the secret (in this case, the keyword is a password: ` git log | grep -A 2 -B 2 password`)
