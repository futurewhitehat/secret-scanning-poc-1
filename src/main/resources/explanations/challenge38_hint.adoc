Unlike other Git challenges this cannot be solved by the plethora of tools that will automatically search for secrets leaked in Git repos.

Try be solving the challenge by manually combing the Git metadata.

Search manually using `git notes`
- Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:OWASP/wrongsecrets.git`
- Navigate to the directory `cd wrongsecrets`
- Fetch the notes `git fetch origin refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*`
- List all notes in the repo `git notes`
- Using the note reference that is displayed show the note `git notes show [ref]` (2 references will show for each note, the second one is the note reference)
