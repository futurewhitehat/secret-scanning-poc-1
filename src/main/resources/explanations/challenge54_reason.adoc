=== Why placing secrets in .gitignore is a security risk?

Developers regularly update configuration files like `.gitignore`, occasionally leaving sensitive information behindâ€”such as passwords, tokens, or critical file paths. These secrets, even encrypted, pose risks:

- Attackers could discover and decrypt the secrets.
- Forgotten secrets in public files indicate poor security practices and weak secret management.

This challenge demonstrates the importance of code reviews and ensuring secrets are never accidentally committed or left behind.
