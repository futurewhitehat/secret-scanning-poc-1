=== Spring Boot Actuator Audit Event

The developers decided to leverage the power of Spring Boot Actuator
to monitor and audit their application. The project involved interfacing with various external APIs,
each requiring a unique key for authentication. The audit events, detailed and informative, seemed like
the perfect solution for monitoring the inner working of their system.

The team implemented a logging mechanism that included detailed audit events.
Unbeknownst to them, these logs contained traces of the sacred API keys, hidden in plain sight within
the audit events.

Can you find this API key?
