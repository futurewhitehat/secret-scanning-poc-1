Why using code to put secrets in is a bad idea.

As you can tell by now, you can easily detect many secrets that stored within code. Even when the code is compiled, you can still reverse-engineer it to find the secret. Therefore hardcoded secrets are never a good idea.
To make it worse: if the dev leaves the organization, he might know the secret as it is still in code! Similarly, when code is leaked or the asset is leaked, the secret will be compromised, and rotating will be hard. Besides: do you still know where this password is for after a few years?
